# Query Patterns

## Schema

Run `mzci schema --root "$PWD"` to inspect the tables and columns in the current database. The reference below describes the expected current schema.

`files`

- `id`: integer primary key
- `path`: repository-relative path
- `language`: detected language, nullable
- `extension`: file extension
- `size`: byte size
- `mtime`: filesystem modification time
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 content digest

`symbols`

- `id`: integer primary key
- `file_id`: `files.id`
- `path`: repository-relative path
- `language`: detected language
- `kind`: `function`, `method`, `class`, `module`, `type`, `trait`, `enum`, `interface`, `constant`, or `section`
- `name`: extracted symbol name
- `line`: 1-based line number
- `end_line`: 1-based inclusive end line; equals `line` when the extractor does
  not know the symbol range
- `column`: 1-based column number
- `signature`: matched definition line
- `context`: nearby source lines

`lines`

- `file_id`: `files.id`
- `line`: 1-based line number
- `text`: line text

`file_metrics`

- `file_id`: `files.id`
- `path`: repository-relative path
- `language`: detected language, nullable
- `line_count`: total indexed lines
- `blank_lines`: blank lines
- `comment_lines`: likely comment lines
- `code_lines`: likely code lines
- `symbol_count`: extracted symbol count for the file

`files_fts`

- FTS5 table with `path`, `language`, and full file `content`
- Available only when the installed `sqlite3` command supports FTS5

`symbols_fts`

- FTS5 table with `name`, `kind`, `language`, `path`, `signature`, and `context`
- Available only when the installed `sqlite3` command supports FTS5

## Definition Lookup

Find exact symbol names:

```sql
select path, line, kind, name, signature
from symbols
where name = 'parse_config' collate nocase
order by path, line;
```

Find similarly named methods:

```sql
select path, line, kind, name, signature
from symbols
where name like '%config%' collate nocase
order by
  case
    when name = 'config' collate nocase then 0
    when name like 'config%' collate nocase then 1
    else 2
  end,
  path,
  line
limit 50;
```

Restrict to a language in mixed-language repositories:

```sql
select path, line, kind, name, signature
from symbols
where language = 'ruby'
  and name like '%route%' collate nocase
order by path, line;
```

When language detection is ambiguous, combine `language`, `extension`, and `path` predicates.

## File Lookup

Find paths by name:

```sql
select path, language, size
from files
where path like '%controller%' collate nocase
order by path
limit 100;
```

Find files of one language:

```sql
select path
from files
where language = 'python'
order by path;
```

## Source Text Lookup

Prefer FTS when available:

```sql
select path
from files_fts
where files_fts match 'timeout'
limit 50;
```

Fallback to indexed lines:

```sql
select files.path, lines.line, lines.text
from lines
join files on files.id = lines.file_id
where lines.text like '%timeout%' collate nocase
order by files.path, lines.line
limit 100;
```

## Metrics Lookup

Summarize indexed languages:

```sql
select language,
       count(*) as files,
       sum(line_count) as lines,
       sum(code_lines) as code,
       sum(comment_lines) as comments,
       sum(symbol_count) as symbols
from file_metrics
group by language
order by code desc, files desc;
```

Find large files with few extracted symbols:

```sql
select path, language, line_count, code_lines, symbol_count
from file_metrics
where code_lines >= 300
  and symbol_count <= 2
order by code_lines desc
limit 50;
```

## Call-Site Or Reference Lookup

This index is regex-based and does not build a typed call graph. For likely
call sites, use `refs`:

```bash
"$TOOL" refs --format json parse_config
```

The command performs case-sensitive complete-identifier matching by default,
keeps comments and strings searchable, excludes exact symbol definition rows,
and includes enclosing lexical scope when symbol ranges are available.
For custom matching, query the same tables directly:

```sql
select files.path, lines.line, lines.text
from lines
join files on files.id = lines.file_id
where lines.text like '%parse_config%' collate nocase
  and not exists (
    select 1
    from symbols
    where symbols.file_id = lines.file_id
      and symbols.line = lines.line
      and symbols.name = 'parse_config' collate nocase
  )
order by files.path, lines.line
limit 100;
```

Open candidate files before relying on these rows for code changes.
